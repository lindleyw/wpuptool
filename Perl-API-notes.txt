Required for CPAN install of WWW::Namecheap::API

  yum install perl-XML-SAX
  yum install perl-XML-SAX-ExpatXS
  yum install perl-XML-Simple
  yum install perl-LWP-Protocol-https 
  yum install perl-Test-Deep

I also had to manually install it... why?  Each time I did

  cpan> install WWW::Namecheap::API

it would seem to install, and doing the install again within the same session of cpan would say already installed and do nothing:

   Running install for module 'WWW::Namecheap::API'
   Running Build for T/TW/TWILDE/WWW-Namecheap-API-0.05.tar.gz
   Has already been unwrapped into directory
      /root/.cpan/build/WWW-Namecheap-API-0.05-m2rdR1

but exiting cpan and re-entering it... it would re-install all over
again, and upon exiting cpan it would not be installed at all!
AAAARGH

So I finally figured you could go into the directory listed and
manually:

   cp -a lib/WWW/ /usr/local/share/perl5/
